The project *MOOCTextEditor or Smart Text Editor* was designed and developed as part of the Coursera course Data Structure and Performance that provides functionality of autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. Each module of the course required implementing backend code for the text editor where front-end a runnable JavaFX program and certain graders and tester classes was provided by the UCSD to test and demonstrate the implementations. The Flesch Readability Score is a measure of the reading complexity of text.
